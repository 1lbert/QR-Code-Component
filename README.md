## My process
- Fix HMTL Elements; Put Semantic HTMl and Div container 
- Design your web in style.css, link first the style.css to index.html, 
- then checked if Responsive in both Mobile and Desktop view  

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
At first, I thought this challenge would be easy and will not take too long to accomplish it. but as soon as I did, it tooks me exactly 38mins to finished the task completely. Although I know most of the HTML Element and CSS styling. I did not expect to take a long time to finished this. This challenge humbles me down and I decided to take more challenges just to be more efficient Web developer.

### Continued development
Be mindful to put sematic elements and div container to properly design the elements in the style sheet.
